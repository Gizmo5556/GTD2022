A couple notes:

- To clear the game, you must earn at least 3 medals on any map, on any difficulty. The clear screen will then be unlocked on the rightmost section of the map menu.

- You can access the options by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom right on the map selection screen. This includes volume, fullscreen, etc.

- You can choose a "targeting priority" for most towers, which changes which enemy they prioritize attacking. The four main ones are:
	FIRST: aims at the fruit closest to the exit
	LAST: aims at the fruit closest to the entrance
	CLOSE: aims at the fruit physically closest to the tower
	STRONG: aims at the strongest fruit
	
- To exit from a map, press escape on the keyboard. To exit the game, press escape while on the map selection screen/title screen.

- To go back to the title screen/restart the game, press F2.

- To take a screenshot, press F9.
